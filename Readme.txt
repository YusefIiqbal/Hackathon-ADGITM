Idea for Hackathon ADGITM:
Creating a Health tracking watch using Arduino UNO which deploys data analytics funcitons to keep a real time record of the user.
The watch comes with Heart Beat sensor, Air Quality sensor and Breath Alcohol content. The data of these watches will be stored in
a CSV file which will be updated on the users phone where the data will be analysed and the user's health status will be tracked.

Dependencies:
-Arduino UNO
-Alcohol Sensor
-Air Quality Sensor
-Heart Beat Sensor
